# About The Project 
With the adverse effects of climate change ravaging the environment, sustainability has become the buzz word of the decade. Creating and embracing sustainable energy solutions has become a primary need in the fight against climate change. Natural gas being a greener option has been studied over time as the answer to the question. 
This project was inspired by the need to apply machine learning to solve a throbbing issue in the adoption of natural gas as a primary energy source-forecasting natural gas prices. Due to the volatile nature of the gas market, this has proven to be rather difficult over time. 
Four machine learning algoriths were applied, namely:
* Support Vector Regression 
* Random Forest Regression 
* Gradient Boosting Machine 
* Artificial Neural Networks 
Model evaluation was carried out by checking the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value generated by each algorithm. The ANN ultimately generated the lowest RMSE in this study.
